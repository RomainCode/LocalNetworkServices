# LocalNetworkServices
LocalNetworkServices is a program which facilitates interactions between computers on a local network.

Hello ! I present to you my python LAN software !
There is what you can do with this program :
You can access some services on LAN (chat/message service, file service and settings service).
- Message service : You can send messages to all the other clients (like a group chat).
- File : You can send a file to one or more clients and the recipient(s) will accept the file.
- Settings : You can actually only modify your nickname or view the others clients (nickname + ip with port).


### How does it work ?
Â There are 2 major paths :
- The transmission between the server and the clients : I use the "socket" library to transfer information between all these programs. The server and the client can communicate in the 2 ways. I created a kind of "protocol of transmission" who is really simple. The idea is to use python dictionaries to contain the data. Next, I transform it into a string with a function, I transform the data in bytes and I send the request ! The receiver will do the same process but backwards (I use the same functions to decode and code string to dictionary and dictionary to string). On the server side, I choose to match one thread by client to avoid big crashes and a slowdown if many users interact with the server at the same time. Indeed to avoid crashes it's a good solution because if a client crashes it won't normally crash the others threads (and it's seam easier to handle).
- The GUI : By GUI I use the library "eel" (which allows me to use HTML/CSS/JS to create a "fancy" GUI and to transfer data between the web page and python). Indeed, I should have used Tkinter but creating a dynamic and fancy GUI with Tkinter it's a bit complicated. "eel" is a GUI based on Chrome and links between python and the web page. I only do a complete GUI for the client (because there is nearly nothing to do with the server in terms of user interactions). Otherwise I used Tkinter (very simply) as a IP/port chooser for the server and a file chooser for the client. And also a client error pop-up but it does nothing really useful.
